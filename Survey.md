Java is a programming language. To run a Java program, we need to write the source code first, then compile the source code 
into byte code using "javac". This byte code is a representation of source code in a compact way, which has benefit in 
transporting through network. To run these byte code, a virtual machine is required. The Java virtual machine is called a 
virtual machine, since it is a software machine simulating what a real machine does. The Java virtual machine (JVM) has its own 
instruction set, a virtual computer architecture, and an execution model. With these components, the JVM can do whatever a real
machine would do.
